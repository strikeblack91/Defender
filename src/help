To help you in this task you have a big Red Castle, it has its own ammunition and it
fires automatically. You will gain gold as you get through the different levels,
the longer you survive the better!!

    Your Red Castle charateristics:
        health => 1000
        damage => 100
        range => 300

You have the possibility to spend the gold you earned on new buildings that will
either give you extra fire power or increase your gold mining capabilities.
The available buildings are the following:

    - Small turret:
        health  => 100
        damage  => 40
